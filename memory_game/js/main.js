/*
Navigate to the main.js file in Sublime.

Create four variables that simulate the cards in your game.

They should be string types.

Two should have a value of "queen", and the other two should have a value of "king".

They will represent your cards (e.g., "queen" card).

Name your variables cardOne, cardTwo, cardThree, and cardFour.

Here's an example of one card:

var cardOne = "queen"; */
